## Description

This assignment had me develop a social network api that will create users, let users make comments and add friends, and delete comments and friends. I used MongoDB, Express, and moment to make this a functional api.

## Installation

Clone the repository on to your device:

`git clone https://github.com/Iviviana/Social-Network-Api.git`

Alternatively, [here's](https://github.com/Iviviana/Social-Network-Api.git) the link to the repository as well.

Run `npm install` in the project directory to install all packages from the `packages.json`.

Aside from installing this repository, you will need <b>MAMP</b>, <b>Insomnia</b>, and <b>MongoDB</b> to run this API.

## Usage

Once all required software and dependencies are installed, you will need to start <b>MAMP</b>, and you will use <b>Insomnia</b> to check if your routes are working. Note, the base port used is `3001`, you can change to host in a different port by changing it in the `server.js` file.

Start the server by runing `node server.js` on the project directory. Use <b>Insomnia</b> now to use <b>POST</b>, <b>GET</b>, and <b>DELETE</b> requests to add, fetch, and delete users and thoughts.
Below is a small demo that will demonstrate the working API.
